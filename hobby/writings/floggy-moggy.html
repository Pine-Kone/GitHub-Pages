    <h2>The Tale of Floggy Moggy</h2>
    <div class="story-text">
      <p>  A little while back, in a mossy‚Ä¶ muggy‚Ä¶ musty‚Ä¶ swamp you‚Äôve never heard of, was a little swamp froggy named Floggy. Floggy was different from all the other froggies. Most swamp froggies liked to jump and eat bugs and even sing! Not Floggy. He liked to sit in the swampiest swamp mud and think, and think, and think. He would spend all day thinking about the swamp, and about his love of the swamp, and of all those who enjoyed the swamp with him.
        One particular day, while out thinking in his swampy mud, Floggy‚Äôs mind seized upon a thought he hadn‚Äôt considered much about before. While thinking about the swamp he loved so much, Floggy realized there weren‚Äôt any female froggies in the swamp who he could have as his companion. They were all either too old, or too young, or very much married. Floggy watched admiringly as other froggies danced in pairs, their croaks intertwining into harmonious duets. He imagined himself joining with them, holding the one to whom he had committed his life. Yes, Floggy longed to have someone to share his little bit of swamp with, as other‚Äôs croaks echoed in his mind, reminders of his non-existent counterpart.
        While caught in this thought, a sudden dizzying swirl of swampy magic flashed before Floggy‚Äôs eyes! As the swampy magic mist cleared, Floggy‚Äôs mud dappled eyes connected with those of the beautiful, legendary, and mystical swamp witch. In a voice as soft as swampy cattail fluff, the swamp witch said, ‚ÄúHello Floggy. I see you are deep in thought, as always. What are you thinking about today?‚Äù
        ‚ÄúOh beautiful, legendary, and mystical swamp witch,‚Äù Floggy said with revere. ‚ÄúI so very much love my little portion of swamp muck. I was just thinking about how nice it would be for me to find a lovely female froggy to share it with. Someone who could sit by my side and croak our deepest thinking thoughts to each other as we appreciate the mossy canopy and slender reeds as we rest here in the mud.‚Äù
        ‚ÄúFloggy, you strong little thinker.‚Äù responded the witch in a way that made Floggy feel proud. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain you know all of the legends about my swamp witch power. Undoubtedly you‚Äôve pondered for days the limitations of how my power allows me to grant but one wish to those who lay eyes on me. And certainly you also know my magic prevents me from making others fall in love. While I can‚Äôt bestow love upon another, I think I can offer a solution. Though, it will come at a cost. If you will change your name to Floggy Moggy, I will bring a lovely female froggy to the swamp. But remember, a name carries the power to help shape a destiny. The world has never known another Floggy Moggy. The responsibility of carrying a new name into the world may prove to be great. With all this in mind, Floggy, what is it that you wish?‚Äù
        Floggy thought, and thought, and thought some more. He liked his name. Who wouldn‚Äôt? To make a change, preposterous? To something as nonsensical as ‚ÄúFloggy Moggy,‚Äù he shuddered at the thought. Though, he was intrigued at the thought of establishing a new name in the world. Of shaping the name for greatness. At the same time, he wasn‚Äôt oblivious to the reality that failure to shape the name into one of honor could result in a froggy flop. And based on his experience in his swampy locale, he knew a froggy flop was the last thing the world needed more of. With all this considered, calming croaks in the distance reminded him of what he desired most. Understanding there was no guarantee of true love, the idea of the opportunity leap frogged him forward.
        As the cool muddy water slowly muddled past Floggy, having accepted whatever fate might come with a new name, he finally said, ‚ÄúOh beautiful, legendary and mystical swamp witch. I would so very much like to share this heavenly piece of swamp with someone I love. I will change my name to Floggy Moggy in hopes of finding a lovely swamp froggy wife.‚Äù The moment Floggy croaked out his last word, the beautiful, legendary, and mystical swamp witch disappeared in a magical swampy flurry, and before Floggy Moggy‚Äôs eyes sat the most lovely, the most enchanting, the most wonderful swamp frog Floggy Moggy had ever seen. Captivated by her emerald-green skin that glistened in the sunsetting light, he nearly forgot where he was or what he was doing. In a gentle voice full of wonder and awe, Floggy Moggy croaked, ‚ÄúHello.‚Äù The lovely, enchanting, wonderful froggy turned toward Floggy Moggy with a, ‚ÄúHello-OH MY GOODNESS!‚Äù The shrill scream could disrupt even Floggy Moggy‚Äôs deepest thoughts. ‚ÄúYou are the UGLIEST swamp frog I have ever seen in my entire swamp frog life!!!‚Äù Floggy Moggy‚Äôs heart sunk deeper than a grumpy catfish's burrow.
        Recognizing the need to act quickly, Floggy Moggy decided to take a leap of faith, ‚ÄúMy apologies, miss. It‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre the most lovely, the most enchanting, the most wonderful froggy I have ever seen.‚Äù He took a deep breath before continuing. ‚ÄúLet me introduce myself. My name is Floggy Moggy. And I would very much like to have you as my wife.‚Äù Floggy Moggy‚Äôs body came to a standstill as he braced for her rejection. The minute the words ‚ÄúFloggy Moggy‚Äù left Floggy Moggy‚Äôs mouth, the lovely, enchanting, and wonderful female froggy‚Äôs face changed. To his surprise, she replied, ‚ÄúWell, you are the most wretched and ugly creature I‚Äôve ever seen. But, your name. I have never heard a name so beautiful before.‚Äù With a soft smile she replied, ‚ÄúI love your name so much that I suppose I can look past how hideous you are. I would love to be your wife.‚Äù
        A few swamp filled days after their first encounter, Floggy Moggy and the lovely, enchanting, wonderful female froggy married. Amidst the tranquil melodies of the swamp, they exchanged vows and embarked on their new life together. Not long after that, they began their family together. Floggy Moggy, Mrs. Moggy, and all the poliwoggies lived happily ever after in their swampy paradise.
